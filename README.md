# Merging DataFrames and LEGO kit sales Charting with MatPlotLib, Pandas, Python in Colab Notebooks.
- 👋 Hi, I’m @WilliamSpanfelner
- 👀 I’m interested in using Python with Swift in iOS environments and why it may or may not be desirable.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python with the London App Brewery and Angela Yu's [100 Days of Code: 
The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) on Udemy.  
- 🧑‍💻 Colab/Jupyter notebooks projects exploring the sales of LEGO kits with Scatter and Bar charting as well as charting on multiple axes. It never occurred to me that there might be a LEGO kit with almost 10,000 pieces! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on application development.
- 📫 How to reach me...
